# performs meta-analysis of present study and Hardwicke et al. (2018)
# the code below will perform two meta-analyses for the article-level reproducibility outcomes.
# one meta-analysis is for reproducibility outcomes before contacting authors
# the other meta-analysis is for reproducibility outcomes after contacting authors
# we will synthesize data from Hardwicke et al. (2018) with data from the present study
# because both studies had similar goals and designs.

# prepare Hardwicke et al. data

## get the total number of articles
hardwicke2018_totalN <- data_hardwicke2018 %>%
  nrow()

## get the number of successful cases prior to author assistance
hardwicke2018_preAuthorSuccess_n <- data_hardwicke2018 %>%
  count(outcome) %>%
  filter(outcome == "Success") %>%
  pull(n)

## get the number of successful cases after author assistance
hardwicke2018_postAuthorSuccess_n <- data_hardwicke2018 %>%
  count(outcome) %>%
  filter(outcome %in% c("Success", "Success with author assistance")) %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()

# prepare present study data

## get the total number of articles
presentStudy_totalN <- articleLevelSummary %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()

## get the number of successful cases prior to author assistance
presentStudy_preAuthorSuccess_n <- articleLevelSummary %>%
  filter(finalOutcome == "Reproducible\nwithout author\ninvolvement") %>%
  pull(n)

## get the number of successful cases after author assistance
presentStudy_postAuthorSuccess_n <- articleLevelSummary %>%
  filter(finalOutcome %in%
    c(
      "Reproducible\nwithout author\ninvolvement",
      "Reproducible\nwith author\ninvolvement"
    )) %>%
  pull(n) %>%
  sum()
