percentageError,The percentage error between the reportedValue and the obtainedValue,Automated calculation by reproCheck function,Numeric,Not applicable
comparisonOutcome,Reproducibility outcome of the comparison between reportedValue and obtainedValue,Automated calculation by reproCheck function,Categorical,"""MATCH"" = values are identical; ""MINOR_ERROR"" = percentage error is greater than 0% and less than 10%; ""MAJOR_ERROR"" = percentage error is greater than or equal to 10%"
eyeballCheck,"In cases where the obtainedValue had to be compared to a figure or a threshold (e.g., p < .05) we performed a visual comparison (eyeball check) and manually determined the outcome of the comparison",Manual entry by pilot/coiplot in reproducibility check,Categorical,"""TRUE"" = eyeball check performed, values match; ""FALSE"" = eyeball check performed, values do not match; NA = no eyeball check performed (eyeball check was not required)."
