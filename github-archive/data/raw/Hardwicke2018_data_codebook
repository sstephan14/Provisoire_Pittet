Project title: Data availability, reusability, and analytic reproducibility: Evaluating the impact of a mandatory open data policy at the journal Cognition
Data file title: reproducibilityData.csv

These data were generated by the reproducibility reports (https://osf.io/p7vkj/) and concatenated.

The data file has one row per article. Below we explain the columns in the data file and what they contain.


id: A unique 5-character article id number generated by TEH
valuesChecked: the number of individual values we tried to reproduce
eyeballs: the number of times we had to visually compare an original reported value with a value obtained in our analysis rather than use the automated compareValues() function (this was necessary when exact values were not reported e.g., p <.05)

Total_df: number of degrees of freedom values checked
Total_p: number of p values checked
Total_mean: number of means checked
Total_sd: number of standard deviations checked
Total_se: number of standard errors checked
Total_ci: number of confidence intervals checked
Total_bf: number of Bayes Factors checked
Total_t: number of t values checked
Total_F: number of F values checked
Total_median: number of medians checked
Total_irr: number of inter-rater reliability values checked
Total_r: number of Pearson's correlation coefficients checked
Total_z: number of z values values checked
Total_n: number of proportions or counts checked
Total_x2: number of chi-squared values checked
Total_other: number of values (not any of the above) checked

NOTE: the value definitions above also apply to all columns in the format Major_value. These columns report the number of Major Numerical Errors for that value

Insufficient_Information_Errors: number of insufficient information errors recorded
Decision_Errors: number of Decision Errors
Major_Numerical_Errors: number of Major Numerical Errors
Minor_Numerical_Errors: number of Minor Numerical Errors
affectsConclusion: our judgement as to whether reproducibility issues substantially affect the original conclusions (either "unlikely" or "unclear").

error_typo: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to typographical errors
error_specification: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to incomplete, inaccurate, or unclear analysis specification in the original article
error_analysis: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to errors in the original authors' analysis
error_data: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to problems with the data file(s) provided by the original authors
error_unidentified: number of discrete reproducibility issues that had an unidentified causal locus
Author_Assistance: was author assistance requested and provided (yes = TRUE, no = FALSE).
resolved_typo: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to typographical errors that were resolved after author assistance
resolved_specification: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to incomplete, inaccurate, or unclear analysis specification in the original article that were resolved after author assistance
resolved_analysis: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to errors in the original authors' analysis that were resolved after author assistance
resolved_data: number of discrete reproducibility issues related to problems with the data file(s) provided by the original authors that were resolved after author assistance

correction_suggested: did the authors suggest to us they would publish a correction
correction_published: did the authors publish a correction (to our knowledge)

outcome: overall outcome of the reproducibility check (Success, Success with author assistance, Failure despite author assistance)
